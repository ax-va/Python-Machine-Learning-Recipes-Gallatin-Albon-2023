*feature matrix* = matrix where rows corresponds to features, and each column is observations of a feature 

*feature extraction* = projecting features to significantly fewer dimensions keeping high-quality models

*feature selection* = selecting high-quality, informative features and dropping less useful features

Three types of feature selection methods:
- *Filter methods* select the best features by examining their statistical properties.
- *Wrapper methods* use trial and error to find the subset of features
that produces models with the highest quality predictions.
- *Embedded methods* select the best feature subset as part of, as an extension of,
a learning algorithm's training process.
