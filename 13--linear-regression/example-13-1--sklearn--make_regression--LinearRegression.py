"""
Train a model that represents a linear relationship between the feature and target vector.

Relationship between a target and only three features is represented as follows:
y = beta_0 + beta_1 * feature_1 + beta_2 * feature_2 + beta_3 * feature_3 + error,
where beta_0 is called bias or also intercept.
