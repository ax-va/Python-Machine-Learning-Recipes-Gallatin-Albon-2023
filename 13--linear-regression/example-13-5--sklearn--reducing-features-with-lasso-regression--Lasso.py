"""
Simplify your linear regression model by reducing the number of features.

In ridge regression, we minimize
$RSS + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p beta_j^2$,
where beta_j for j=1,...,p are feature coefficients and \alpha is a hyperparameter.

In lasso regression, we minimize
$RSS/(2n) + \alpha \sum_{j=1}^p \abs{beta_j}$,
where n is the number of observations.

A general rule of thumb:
ridge regression often produces slightly better predictions than lasso,
but lasso produces more interpretable models.

elastic net = a regression model with both penalties included

One final note:
In linear regression, the value of the coefficients is partially determined by the scale of the feature,
and in regularized models, all coefficients are summed together.
->
Make sure to standardize the feature prior to training.

Lasso regression's penalty can shrink the coefficients of a model to zero,
effectively reducing the number of features in the model.
->
Reduce variance while improving the interpretability of our model
since fewer features are easier to explain.
