# Machine Learning Recipes in Python

Machine learning recipes in Python with **scikit-learn**, **OpenCV**, **PyTorch**, and other libraries, including classical machine learning and neural networks, based on the book *"Machine Learning with Python Cookbook: Practical Solutions from Preprocessing to Deep Learning"*, Second Edition, by Kyle Gallatin and Chris Albon published by O'Reilly Media in 2023.

My environment was Python 3.11 with the packages in `requirements.txt`.
