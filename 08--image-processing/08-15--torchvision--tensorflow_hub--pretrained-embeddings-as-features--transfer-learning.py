"""
Load pretrained embeddings from an existing model in PyTorch
and use them as input to one of your own models.

->

Use *transfer learning* = use pretrained image models such as ResNet.

For example, use the weights of a model trained to recognize cats
as a good start for a model to train to recognize dogs.

->

Leverage the information learned from other datasets and model
architectures without the overhead of training a model from scratch.

ResNet18 is a pretrained model, an 18-layers NN that was trained on the ImageNet dataset.
